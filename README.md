- 👋 Hi, I’m @MRMardis
- 👀 I’m interested in astro photography
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing until I've learned what's going on here
- 📫 How to reach me please don't
- 😄 Pronouns: zip, zap, and zowie!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I graduated with a Comp Sci Bachelor's and a CIS Master's back on the '80s.  Am now retired from the USAF and from IBM.  Wanting to come up to speed with a modern language like Rust.
